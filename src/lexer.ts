 *
 * A lone `/` is an ordinary character, which keeps a path or a ratio writable
 * unquoted. `#` is ordinary too: it opens a hex color, which is why comments
 * are spelled `//` rather than the `#` an earlier version used.
 *
 * Parentheses group the modifiers on a placement — `left of hub (gap: wide)` —
 * and are tokens in their own right so that `(gap:` does not read as one word
 * ending in a colon. They are deliberately *not* punctuation everywhere: an
 * opening bracket counts only where a token starts, and a closing one only
 * while a group is open, so an unquoted `rgb(20,20,20)` stays a single token.
 *
 * `depth` is how many brackets are still open from the lines before, when a
 * statement continues onto this one.
 *
 * `line` may hold line breaks, but only inside a `"""` string: `parse` joins
 * the lines such a string spans before handing them over.
 *
 * Returns an empty array for a blank or comment-only line.
